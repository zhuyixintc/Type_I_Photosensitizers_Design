# Type_I_Photosensitizers_Design
We employed a standard application of supervised learning models, using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization and model training. As this work primarily focuses on the materials design and underlying photophysical mechanisms, the machine learning component is intended as a preliminary exploratory study rather than the central contribution of the paper.
