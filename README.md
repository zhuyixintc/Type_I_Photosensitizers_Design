# Type_I_Photosensitizers_Design
We ran a simple supervised learning analysis using standard scikit-learn models. Since our main goal is materials design and understanding the photophysics, we mainly use the data we already have to see what trends show up, especially patterns in the excited-state properties, rather than treating the machine learning part as the main contribution.
